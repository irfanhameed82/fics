## âœ… Development to Production Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables & MySQL Configuration

- Set up the necessary environment variables for database connection in a `.env.local` file.
- Configure MySQL appropriately in your local or production environment. Ensure credentials and database URLs match your setup.

Example `.env.local`:
```env
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_PORT=your_database_port
```

### 2. Video Assets (Cloudinary)

- All video files used in the application are stored in **Cloudinary** under the "ishaq account".
- Due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit, large videos are **not** stored in the repository.

| Video Type        | File Size | Description              |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Introductory Video| 345 MB    | Main welcome introduction|
| Success Video     | 165 MB    | Post-success display     |

These videos are accessed via their **Cloudinary links**.
